## What is SOP Skill?

**SOP Skill** is a Chrome extension that lets you record browser workflows by simply "doing and talking" — it automatically captures your actions and voice narration, then generates a structured SOP (Standard Operating Procedure).

The generated SOP is both **human-friendly** (rich screenshots, clear steps) and **AI-ready** (precise CSS selectors and action semantics that AI agents can execute).

> This directory is the **SOP Skill open-source edition (OSS)**. You bring your own speech API credentials.

> 🎯 **In one sentence**: Do it once, let AI do it a thousand times.

## Features

### 🎙️ Real-time Speech-to-Text
- Supports self-configured **Deepgram** and **Aliyun Qwen Realtime ASR**
- Current recognition options: **Chinese (zh-CN)** and **English (en-US)**
- Voice narration is auto-linked to action steps (non-meaningful text is filtered out)
- Provider credentials stay only in your local browser storage

### 🖱️ Smart Action Capture
- Automatically records clicks, inputs, scrolls, and page navigation
- **Text selection** vs **click** — precisely distinguished
- Intelligent filtering of meaningless actions (blank area clicks, etc.)
- Auto-identifies element types (buttons, links, inputs, icons, etc.)

### 📸 Inline Thumbnail Screenshots
- Auto-captures and annotates screenshots for **click** and **select** events
- Thumbnails are embedded inside action pills (same pattern during recording and preview)
- Click any thumbnail to open a larger viewer

### 📋 Single-Page Hybrid Timeline
- **Recording** and **post-stop preview** share the same timeline view
- **Voice** → merged narration blocks, with the placeholder text `识别中`
- **Actions** → compact pills, with merged scroll display (for example `Scroll xN`)

### 📄 Standalone HTML Export
- One-click export to self-contained HTML file
- Rich visual output with segmented narration and screenshots
- Send directly to colleagues or upload to AI agents
- Built-in guide plus "Execution Details (For Agent)" for automation

## Recent Updates (2026-03)

- Refreshed extension icon assets: `icons/icon16.png`, `icons/icon48.png`, `icons/icon128.png`, `icons/logo.png`
- The OSS edition now supports self-configured `Deepgram` and `Aliyun Qwen Realtime ASR`
- Recording and preview were unified into one timeline page
- Sidebar wording was updated to "Execution Details (For Agent)"
- Voice placeholder changed from line marks to `识别中`
- Action pills now support inline screenshot thumbnails with click-to-zoom
- Unrecognized / non-meaningful speech text (for example `...` or punctuation-only) is no longer shown in timeline/preview
- Scroll actions are filtered by PRD rules and merged in live timeline (for example `Scroll xN`)
- The Aliyun realtime path now has a safer stop flow plus `AudioWorklet` capture fallback

```

- **content.js** — injected into pages to capture user actions (clicks, inputs, text selection)
- **sidepanel.js** — sidebar UI, unified recording/preview timeline, Deepgram / Aliyun speech recognition, SOP export
- **background.js** — service worker for recording state, SOP generation, and screenshot annotation
- **annotate.js** — offscreen document for marking click positions on screenshots
- **aliyun-pcm-worklet.js** — PCM capture worklet used by the Aliyun realtime path

## Privacy & Security

- 🔒 **API Key stored locally** — Only in `chrome.storage.local`, never uploaded
- 🔒 **Voice data** — Sent directly to your selected provider (Deepgram or Aliyun); SOP Skill stores no audio
- 🔒 **Screenshots** — Processed entirely in your browser, never leave your machine
- 🔒 **Open source** — Full source code available for audit
